# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Sebastian here...
## Welcome to my profile!
After years of working in the entertainments industry as a Sound Engineer, I decided that it was time for a new challenge. Channelling my passion for learning, I set a new, personal goal of becoming a Software Developer. This year I have been lucky enough to learn computer programming and build projects full-time, both for my portfolio and for clients.
