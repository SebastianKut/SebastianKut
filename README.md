### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Sebastian here...
#### Welcome to my Github profile
After years of working in the entertainments industry as a Sound Engineer, in April 2020 I decided that it was time for a new challenge. Channelling my passion for learning, I set a new, personal goal of becoming a Front-End Web Developer. Due to unfortunate events of the current health crisis and suspension of operations of the company I was previously working for, I have been able to allocate 8-10 hours a day to learn computer programming and build projects, both for my portfolio and for initial clients. 
If you are interested in working with me, hiring me or simply fancy a chat, feel free to message me.

Skills: JS / HTML / CSS

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything code or digital audio
